# The `retry` parameter specifies how often (in seconds) the Pushover servers
# will send the same notification to the user. In a situation where your user
# might be in a noisy environment or sleeping, retrying the notification (with
# sound and vibration) will help get his or her attention. This parameter must
# have a value of at least 30 seconds between retries.

# The `expire` parameter specifies how many seconds your notification will
# continue to be retried for (every retry seconds). If the notification has not
# been acknowledged in expire seconds, it will be marked as expired and will
# stop being sent to the user. Note that the notification is still shown to the
# user after it is expired, but it will not prompt the user for
# acknowledgement. This parameter must have a maximum value of at most 10800
# seconds (3 hours), though the total number of retries will be capped at 50
# regardless of the expire parameter.
